# Report-Mailer
A simple script to mail reports

This script uses the smtplib and email modules to send an email with a report as the body. It sets the sender, recipient, subject, and body of the email, and creates a message using the MIMEMultipart and MIMEText classes. It then sets the SMTP server and login credentials, and uses the smtplib module to connect to the server and send the email.

To use the script, you will need to replace the placeholder values (e.g. sender@example.com, recipient@example.com, smtp.example.com, username, password) with the appropriate values
